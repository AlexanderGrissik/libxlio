# XLIO - Accelerated IO SW library

## Introduction
XLIO boosts the performance of applications written over standard socket API such as 
web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. Reduction of latency, increasing
throughput and effective CPU utilization is achieved by full network stack bypass and direct access to
accelerated network hardware.
XLIO dynamically links with these applications at run-time, redirect standard socket API calls allowing them to be
be accelerated without modification.
